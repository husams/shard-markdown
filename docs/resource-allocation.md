```

### Critical Path Protection

#### Primary Critical Path

1. **Architect Protection**: Lead Developer focuses on critical path components
2. **Dependency Management**: Ensure Core-002 completion before dependent tasks
3. **Integration Priority**: CLI-002 takes precedence over other CLI commands
4. **Quality Gates**: No phase begins without predecessor completion

#### Secondary Critical Paths

1. **ChromaDB Integration**: Senior Developer dedicated to database components
2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Parallel development to avoid bottlenecks
3. **Documentation**: Early start to avoid end-project crunch

### Resource Contingency Planning

#### Team Member Unavailability

1. **Lead Developer Unavailable**:
   - Senior Developer assumes technical leadership
   - External senior consultant on retainer
   - Critical decisions postponed until return

2. **Senior Developer Unavailable**:
   - Lead Developer takes over database integration
   - Mid-Level Developer promoted to CLI development
   - Timeline extension of 1-2 weeks

3. **Multiple Unavailability**:
   - Contract developers on standby
   - Scope reduction protocol activated
   - Stakeholder communication and timeline revision

#### Skill Gap Mitigation

1. **Technical Expertise Gaps**:
   - External consultants for specialized knowledge
   - Online training and upskilling budget
   - Pair programming with experienced developers

2. **Domain Knowledge Gaps**:
   - User interviews and feedback sessions
   - Domain expert consultation
   - Iterative development with user validation
