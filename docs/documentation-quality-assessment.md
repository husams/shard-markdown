The updated `.github/workflows/docs.yml` should now work correctly. The next CI run will validate the fix.

## Optional Improvements

### Short-term (can be done later)

1. **Reduce Build Warnings**
   - Remove duplicate API documentation from `api-reference.rst`
   - Would reduce warnings from 373 to ~27

2. **Clean External Links**
   - Update placeholder URLs in deployment guide
   - Improves link checking results

### Long-term

1. **Documentation Organization**
   - Move development notes out of docs/ directory
   - Keep only user-facing documentation
