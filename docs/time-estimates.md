## Schedule Optimization Strategies

### Critical Path Optimization
1. **Start High-Risk Tasks Early**: Begin CORE-002 as soon as CORE-001 is functional
2. **Parallel Development**: Develop CHROMA and CLI components simultaneously
3. **Early Integration**: Test component integration frequently
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Deliver working increments for early feedback

### Resource Leveling
1. **Skill Distribution**: Balance complex and simple tasks across team members
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Pair programming for critical components
3. **Backup Planning**: Cross-train team members on critical components

### Schedule Compression Techniques
1. **Fast Tracking**: Parallel execution of normally sequential tasks
2. **Crashing**: Add resources to critical path tasks
3. **Scope Management**: Defer non-critical features to future releases

## Contingency Planning

### Schedule Delays (> 2 weeks behind)
1. **Scope Reduction**: Remove non-critical features (CORE-003, CLI-006)
2. **Resource Addition**: Bring in additional experienced developers
3. **Quality Trade-offs**: Reduce testing scope (maintain >80% coverage)

### Technical Blockers
1. **ChromaDB Issues**: Implement mock database for development
2. **Performance Problems**: Simplify algorithms, optimize later
3. **Integration Failures**: Develop components independently first

### Team Availability Issues
1. **Developer Unavailable**: Cross-training and documentation
2. **Skill Gaps**: External consultation or training
3. **Tool/Environment Issues**: Alternative development approaches

## Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope
**Estimated Time Reduction**: 40-50 hours (15-20% faster)

**Features to Defer**:
- CORE-003 (Alternative chunking strategies)
- CLI-006 (Utility commands)
- Advanced error recovery
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive documentation

### Quality Gates vs. Schedule Pressure
1. **Non-Negotiable**: Core functionality, basic testing, security
2. **Negotiable**: Documentation completeness, advanced features
3. **Deferrable**: Performance optimization, comprehensive error handling

This time estimation provides a realistic foundation for project planning while accounting for the inherent uncertainties in software development.
