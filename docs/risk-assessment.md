  - 4-6 weeks delay in core development
  - Potential need for algorithm redesign
  - Cascading delays to CLI and integration phases

- **Business Impact**:
  - Core value proposition may be compromised
  - User adoption could be limited by poor performance

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early Prototyping** (Pre-development)
   - Implement proof-of-concept before full development
   - Test with realistic document samples
   - Benchmark against performance requirements

2. **Incremental Development** (During development)
   - Start with simple algorithm, iterate for optimization
