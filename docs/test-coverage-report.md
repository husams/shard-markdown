   - TC-E2E-026: Extreme Content Sizes
   - TC-E2E-027: System Resource Limits
   - TC-E2E-028: Concurrent Execution

## Test Implementation Highlights

### Core Functionality Tests (Priority 1)
All fundamental operations are thoroughly tested:
- Basic file processing
- Custom chunk sizes and overlaps
- All chunking strategies
- Directory processing (recursive and non-recursive)
- ChromaDB storage integration

### Advanced Features (Priority 2)
Complete coverage of advanced capabilities:
- Metadata extraction (3 scenarios)
- Structure preservation
- Dry run mode
- Custom configuration files
- Verbose output levels
- Quiet mode

### Option Combinations (Priority 3)
Comprehensive testing of feature interactions:
- All options combined in single command
- Conflicting option handling
- Strategy and storage combinations
- Size/overlap parameter variations
- Metadata with different strategies
- Recursive processing with filters

### Error Handling (Priority 4)
Robust error condition testing:
- Invalid strategies
- Missing required options
- Invalid input files
- Invalid numeric values
- ChromaDB connection failures
- Invalid collection names
- File permission errors
- Configuration file errors

### Edge Cases (Priority 5)
Extensive edge case coverage:
- Special filename handling
- Mixed line ending support
- Empty directory processing
- Complex markdown structures
- Memory-limited processing
- Large document handling
- Concurrent execution scenarios

## Additional Test Coverage

Beyond the planned 28 test cases, the suite includes:

- **Batch Processing Tests**: Comprehensive batch operation testing
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Extended database interaction scenarios
- **CLI Workflow Tests**: End-to-end user workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Large batch and efficiency testing
- **Module Import Tests**: Package structure validation
- **Symlink Handling**: Circular and regular symlink tests
- **Progress Reporting**: User feedback mechanisms

## Test Organization

Tests are well-structured across 6 modules:

1. `test_simplified_cli.py` - Core CLI functionality
2. `test_batch_processing.py` - Batch operation scenarios
3. `test_chromadb_integration.py` - Database integration
4. `test_cli_workflows.py` - User workflow testing
5. `test_complex_markdown_simplified.py` - Complex document handling
6. `test_tc_e2e_026_027_028.py` - Resource limits and concurrency

## Remaining Work

Only one test case remains partially implemented:
- **TC-E2E-025**: Batch Processing Edge Cases (partially covered in existing batch tests)

This represents less than 4% of the total test plan and is already partially addressed through existing batch processing tests.

## Conclusion

The shard-markdown test suite has exceeded all planned coverage goals, with particular strength in:
- 100% coverage of all critical (Priority 1-4) test cases
- 88% coverage of edge cases (exceeding the 60% target)
- Extensive additional tests beyond the original plan
- Well-organized, maintainable test structure
- Fast execution times suitable for CI/CD

The test suite provides excellent confidence in the reliability and robustness of the shard-markdown tool.
