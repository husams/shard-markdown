# Manual Testing Checklist

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive manual testing checklists for the shard-markdown CLI utility. These tests complement automated testing by validating user experience, edge cases, and scenarios that are difficult to automate.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Virtual environment activated
- [ ] Latest dependencies installed (`uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`)
- [ ] ChromaDB running (if testing real integration)
- [ ] Test data directory prepared
- [ ] Previous test artifacts cleaned up

### Test Data Preparation
```bash
# Create test directory structure
mkdir -p manual_tests/{simple,complex,large,edge_cases}

# Simple test documents
echo "# Simple Document
This is a basic test document.
## Section 1
Content here." > manual_tests/simple/basic.md

# Complex document with frontmatter
cat > manual_tests/complex/with_frontmatter.md << 'EOF'
---
title: "Complex Test Document"
author: "Test User"
tags: ["test", "complex"]
---

# Complex Document
This document has frontmatter and code.

```python
def test_function():
    return "Hello World"
```
EOF

# Large document
python -c "
content = '# Large Document\n\n'
for i in range(100):
    content += f'## Section {i}\n'
    content += 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. ' * 50 + '\n\n'
with open('manual_tests/large/large_doc.md', 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
"
```

## CLI Interface Testing

shard-md process --collection test-encoding manual_tests/edge_cases/bad_encoding.md
```
- [ ] Invalid encoding is detected and handled
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Processing continues with other files in batch

### Configuration Testing

#### Configuration File Usage
```bash
# Create test configuration
cat > test_config.yaml << 'EOF'

  host: localhost
  port: 8000
chunking:
  default_size: 1200
  default_overlap: 240
EOF

shard-md --config test_config.yaml process --collection test-config manual_tests/simple/basic.md
```
- [ ] Configuration file is loaded correctly
- [ ] Settings override defaults appropriately

python -c "
content = '# Huge Document\n\n'
for i in range(10000):
    content += f'## Section {i}\n'
    content += 'Content line. ' * 100 + '\n\n'
with open('manual_tests/edge_cases/huge.md', 'w') as f:

```
- [ ] Very large documents are processed successfully
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] Processing time is acceptable
- [ ] Progress is shown for long operations

#### Malformed Markdown
```bash
# Create malformed markdown
cat > manual_tests/edge_cases/malformed.md << 'EOF'
# Unclosed Code Block
```python
def function():
    return "no closing backticks"

## Header in Code Block?
Still in code block...

# Another header
```

- [ ] Memory is released after processing
- [ ] No memory leaks during repeated operations
- [ ] Memory usage scales appropriately with document size

#### Concurrent Processing
```bash
# Test multiple simultaneous processes
shard-md process --collection test-concurrent-1 manual_tests/large/large_doc.md &
shard-md process --collection test-concurrent-2 manual_tests/complex/with_frontmatter.md &
wait
```

time shard-md process --collection perf-test-3 manual_tests/large/large_doc.md
```
- [ ] Small documents process in <1 second
- [ ] Medium documents process in <5 seconds
- [ ] Large documents process in <30 seconds
- [ ] Performance is consistent across runs

### Batch Processing Performance
```bash
# Create multiple test files
for i in {1..20}; do
    cp manual_tests/simple/basic.md manual_tests/simple/basic_$i.md
done

time shard-md process --collection batch-perf manual_tests/simple/basic_*.md
```
- [ ] Batch processing is faster than individual processing
- [ ] Progress is shown for batch operations
- [ ] Memory usage doesn't grow linearly with batch size
- [ ] Error in one file doesn't affect others
