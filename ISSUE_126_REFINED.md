---

## 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Next Release)

### 1. Low Test Coverage in Critical Modules
**Severity**: 🔴 Critical
**Effort**: Medium

Several critical modules have insufficient test coverage:
- `chromadb/mock_client.py`: **38.13%** coverage
- `cli/commands/config.py`: **59.42%** coverage
- `cli/commands/collections.py`: **67.86%** coverage
- `chromadb/version_detector.py`: **70.09%** coverage

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Increase mock_client.py coverage to ≥80%
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for config command edge cases
- [ ] Test all collection operations including error scenarios
- [ ] Cover all ChromaDB version detection paths

### 2. Missing Error Handling Patterns
**Severity**: 🔴 Critical
**Effort**: Medium

Current error handling is inconsistent across modules. Only 2 files contain custom exceptions.

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
# src/shard_markdown/utils/errors.py
class ShardMarkdownError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all shard-markdown errors."""
    pass

class ConfigurationError(ShardMarkdownError):
    """Configuration-related errors."""
    pass

class ChromaDBConnectionError(ShardMarkdownError):
    """ChromaDB connection failures."""
    pass

class ChunkingError(ShardMarkdownError):
    """Document chunking errors."""
    pass
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error hierarchy
- [ ] Add retry logic for ChromaDB operations
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker for external services
- [ ] Add structured error logging with context

---

## 🟡 High-Priority Improvements

### 3. Type Hints Incomplete
**Severity**: 🟡 High
**Effort**: Easy

Only 72% of files have type hints. Missing in critical areas.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add type hints to all public functions
- [ ] Use `mypy` strict mode in CI
- [ ] Add `py.typed` marker for package
- [ ] Document type aliases in `types.py`

### 4. Performance Optimizations Needed
**Severity**: 🟡 High
**Effort**: Medium

**Identified Bottlenecks**:
```python
# Current implementation in chunking/fixed.py (line 78-85)
# TODO: Optimize for large documents
for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size - overlap):
    chunks.append(text[i:i + chunk_size])
```

**Recommended Optimization**:
```python
# Use generator for memory efficiency
def chunk_generator(text: str, chunk_size: int, overlap: int):
    """Memory-efficient chunking using generator."""
    step = chunk_size - overlap
    for i in range(0, len(text), step):
        yield text[i:i + chunk_size]
```

**Parallelization Strategy**:
⚠️ **Important Note**: Due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), true CPU-bound parallelization is limited. Parallelization benefits apply primarily to:
- **Processing multiple documents concurrently** (I/O-bound operations)
- **Batch processing of document collections**
- **Concurrent ChromaDB API calls**

**NOT applicable to**:
- ❌ Splitting a single document into chunks in parallel (CPU-bound, limited by GIL)
- ❌ Parallel processing within a single document

**Recommended Approach for Multi-Document Processing**:
```python
# Use concurrent.futures for I/O-bound parallel processing
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import asyncio

def process_multiple_documents(documents: List[Path]) -> List[Result]:
    """Process multiple documents concurrently."""
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_single_document, doc)
                   for doc in documents]
        return [f.result() for f in futures]

# Alternative: Use asyncio for async I/O operations
async def process_documents_async(documents: List[Path]) -> List[Result]:
    """Process multiple documents asynchronously."""
    tasks = [process_document_async(doc) for doc in documents]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement streaming for large documents
- [ ] Add concurrent processing for multiple document batches
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for ChromaDB
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Consider using `multiprocessing` for CPU-intensive operations (with overhead awareness)
- [ ] Document GIL limitations in performance guide

### 5. CLI Command Consistency
**Severity**: 🟡 High
**Effort**: Easy

Inconsistent command patterns and help text formatting.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Standardize command output formats
- [ ] Add `--json` flag for all commands
- [ ] Implement consistent error codes
- [ ] Add command aliases for common operations

# Simplify and document
LOG_LEVELS = {
    0: logging.WARNING,  # Default
    1: logging.INFO,     # -v

}
log_level = LOG_LEVELS.get(min(verbose, 2), logging.WARNING)
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Memory Usage
- [ ] Implement streaming for documents >10MB
- [ ] Use generators for chunk iteration
- [ ] Optimize embedding batch sizes
- [ ] Add memory profiling to CI

### Speed Improvements
- [ ] **Concurrent processing of multiple documents** (not parallel chunking of single documents)
- [ ] Batch ChromaDB operations
- [ ] Cache frequently used queries
- [ ] Optimize regex patterns
- [ ] Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for I/O-bound operations
- [ ] Consider `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-intensive batch operations

### Benchmarks to Add
```python
# tests/benchmarks/test_performance.py
@pytest.mark.benchmark
def test_large_document_chunking(benchmark):
    """Benchmark chunking of 100MB document."""
    # Note: Single document processing is sequential
    result = benchmark(chunk_document, large_doc)
    assert result.time < 5.0  # Max 5 seconds

@pytest.mark.benchmark
def test_batch_document_processing(benchmark):
    """Benchmark concurrent processing of multiple documents."""
    # Multiple documents can be processed concurrently
    documents = [create_test_doc(size=10_000_000) for _ in range(10)]
    result = benchmark(process_documents_concurrently, documents)
    assert result.time < 15.0  # Should be faster than sequential
```

### Performance Considerations
**GIL Impact on Parallelization**:
- CPU-bound operations (like text parsing) won't benefit from threading
- I/O-bound operations (file reading, API calls) can benefit from threading
- For true CPU parallelization, consider `multiprocessing` with awareness of overhead
- Document chunking within a single file remains sequential
- Focus optimization efforts on batch processing and I/O concurrency

## ⚠️ Important Constraints

1. **Python Version**: This library **exclusively supports Python 3.12**. No backward compatibility is maintained or tested.

2. **Parallelization Scope**:
   - ✅ **Can parallelize**: Processing multiple documents concurrently
   - ✅ **Can parallelize**: Batch operations across document collections
   - ✅ **Can parallelize**: I/O-bound operations (file reading, API calls)
   - ❌ **Cannot parallelize**: Chunking within a single document
   - ❌ **Cannot parallelize**: CPU-bound operations within single document processing

3. **GIL Considerations**: Python's Global Interpreter Lock affects parallelization strategies:
   - Threading is effective for I/O-bound operations
   - CPU-bound operations require `multiprocessing` (with overhead)
   - Single document processing remains fundamentally sequential
